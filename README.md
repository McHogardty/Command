# Command

A small Python framework for creating command-line programs in a declarative style, inspired by frameworks like [Django](https://github.com/django/django) and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy). At the moment it is a wrapper around the argparse module in the standard library.

TODO:
* Add logging, warnings and errors.
* Make sure that arguments are kept in the order in which they are defined.
